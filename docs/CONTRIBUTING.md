# CONTRIBUTING
Thank you for showing interest in contributing to PGM. I very much appreciate
your interest in helping build this tool.

Before you start submitting a pull request I must ask that you contact me first
through one of the links listed or another way if you can find it. The code is open source
not open contribution. This is one so I know you can be trusted. Don't want 
another Jia Tan lol. As well as making sure what you want to do doesn't go 
against what I feel is best. If so, I encourage you to fork the project and I 
can put a link to your fork on the README for anyone who stumbles across PGM. 
This is also so I know who I am allowing to contribute. This just helps me 
remember your name and possibly make a new friend :)

With that being said...

- When contributing just make sure the git messages are understandable. I do not
care if you joke in them just as long as it informs where you are at in some way.
- For the style guide, please check out [Suckless Coding Style](https://suckless.org/coding_style/)
The only thing that I add on top of that is, defining variables at beginning of
code block and by type and alphabetic order. Pointers -> normal types in alphabetical
order. EX:

```C
static void
fooBar(void)
{
    char* idk;
    char* zorgon;
    char y;
    double foo, z;
    int* x;
}
```
- If you find any bugs or issues please let me know so I can make note of it and
we can go from there.
- If you wish to make more contributions after you did what you wanted please just
contact me again and lets discuss. Im happy to hear what you think can make PGM
better.
- If you want to change the language of PGM just make a fork, im not rewriting
the codebase in Rust, Zig, Go, Javascript, etc.
- If you have any other questions about what to do's like stated earlier please
just ask, i have no problem talking to you (yet).
