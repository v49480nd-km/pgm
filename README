# PGM

## Description

A password/pin generator and management tool written in C. This is a CLI tool
for generating, and managing password/pin pairs on your system. I must advise
their is nothing as secure as writing it down, yes everything is encrypted but
it is still on a device that can be connected to unlike pen and paper.

- This tool was made for the purpose of not only storing password/pin pairs in
an encrypted manner but generating more secure and random passwords/pins.

- The reason this project was made for the purpose of creating a secure encrypted
password generator and management tool as well as practice with CLI programs.
