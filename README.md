# PGM
PGM is a Password Generator and Manager tool written in C. The goal in mind is
to generate password pairs with user given ids up to four characters.

They are stored encrypted in a format similar to

## Contributions
This is not an open source tool for obvious reasons. But I would still like to
accept contributions. If you would like to work on this project. Please contact
me through PGP encryption only. I will not accept any other forms of messaging.
I do not care what you contact me on. As long as it is encrypted I am happy :)
